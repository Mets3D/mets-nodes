Baby's first ComfyUI nodes. Some stolen, some vibe coded.

- ChainReplace: A string node to conveniently chain search-and-replace operations together. In goes the input text, then the text to replace with, then the text to search. I use this to build "unfurling prompts", eg. by replacing <randomcolor> in my prompt with {red|green|blue|yellow|orange}.
- ExtractTagFromString: Kinda like an HTML tag, eg. if the input string is `a girl with <eye>blue eyes</eye>`, this node will extract the `blue eyes` part if you ask it to extract the `eye` tag. Useful for not having to jump between so many different input boxes for prompts, since you can eg. use <neg>to send stuff to your negative prompt</neg> or <face>to send stuff to your FaceDetailer prompt</face>.
- AutoExtractTags: Good to run at the end of your other tag processing nodes, to remove any leftovers. Additionally, if the input contains a tag with an ! like `<!eye>` then the contents of any <eye> tags will be removed. You could use this to replace `blink` in your prompt with `blink <!eye>`, so when you want to quickly make your character blink, you can just add "blink" to your prompt and it will automatically remove any descriptions of eyes. (As long as your eyes are tagged properly)
- StableRandomChoice: I wasn't happy with how ComfyUI or WildCardProcessor handles randomized elements of a prompt, such as {red|green|blue}, particularly when a lot of such randomized elements were in a prompt. When you modify the prompt without adding or removing any randomized elements, you might get a totally different result. Not with this node.
